## Market Analysis I (Medium)

Write an SQL query to find for each user, the join date and the number of orders they made as a buyer in 2019.

##########################################################
```
SELECT u.user_id as buyer_id, u.join_date, 
SUM(case when year(o.order_date) = 2019 then 1 else 0 end) as orders_in_2019
FROM Users u LEFT JOIN Orders o 
ON u.user_id = o.buyer_id
GROUP BY user_id, join_date
ORDER BY user_id
```

## Market Analysis II (Hard)

Write an SQL query to find for each user, whether the brand of the second item (by date) they sold is their favorite brand. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as no.

It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on a day.

```
WITH CTE AS(
    SELECT o.seller_id, o.item_id, i.item_brand, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY seller_id ORDER BY order_date) AS 'rnk'
    FROM Orders o, Items i
    WHERE o.item_id = i.item_id
    )

SELECT u.user_id as seller_id, if(u.favorite_brand = c.item_brand, 'yes', 'no') AS 
2nd_item_fav_brand
FROM users u LEFT JOIN CTE c 
ON u.user_id = c.seller_id
AND c.rnk = 2
ORDER BY u.user_id
