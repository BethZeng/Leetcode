## Game Play Analysis 

## Table 

* Activity

| Column Name  | Type    |
---- | ---
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.

This table shows the activity of players of some game.

Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.

## Game Play Analysis I (Easy)

Write an SQL query that reports the first login date for each player.

##########################################
```
SELECT a.player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM Activity a 
GROUP BY player_id
```
##########################################

## Game Play Analysis II (Easy)

Write a SQL query that reports the device that is first logged in for each player.

##########################################
```
SELECT a.player_id, a.device_id
FROM Activity a,
(SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) as e 
 FROM Activity 
 GROUP BY player_id) z
WHERE a.player_id = z.player_id and a.event_date = z.e
```

## Game Play Analysis III (Medium)

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

##########################################
```
SELECT a.player_id, a.event_date, 
       SUM(games_played) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id 
                               ORDER BY event_date)
                               AS games_played_so_far 
FROM Activity a 
```
##########################################

## Game Play Analysis IV (Medium)

Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

##########################################
```
SELECT round(SUM(CASE WHEN s1.min_date = a.event_date-1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 
                END)/COUNT(DISTINCT s1.player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM (SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS min_date
     FROM Activity
     GROUP BY player_id) as s1
LEFT JOIN Activity as a 
ON s1.player_id = a.player_id
```
