## Team Scores in Football Tournament (Medium)

## Table 
* Teams

| Column Name   | Type     |
---- | ---
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |

team_id is the primary key of this table.

Each row of this table represents a single football team.

* Matches

| Column Name   | Type    |
---- | ----
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     | 
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |

match_id is the primary key of this table.

Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams. 

Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the teams table (team_id) and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals respectively.

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:

A team receives three points if they win a match (Score strictly more goals than the opponent team).

A team receives one point if they draw a match (Same number of goals as the opponent team).

A team receives no points if they lose a match (Score less goals than the opponent team).

Write an SQL query that selects the team_id, team_name and num_points of each team in the tournament after all described matches. Result table should be ordered by num_points (decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the records by team_id (increasing order).
