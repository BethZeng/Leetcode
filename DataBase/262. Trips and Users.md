The Trips table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are both foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table. Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).

The Users table holds all users. Each user has an unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of (‘client’, ‘driver’, ‘partner’).

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned users (both client and driver must be unbanned) between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013. The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests made by unbanned users by the total number of requests made by unbanned users.

For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows with the cancellation rate being rounded to two decimal places.


Solution:

SELECT T.request_at AS `Day`, 
	ROUND(
			SUM(
				IF(T.STATUS = 'completed',0,1)
			)
			/ 
			COUNT(T.STATUS),
			2
	) AS `Cancellation Rate`
FROM Trips AS T
JOIN Users AS U1 ON (T.client_id = U1.users_id AND U1.banned ='No')
JOIN Users AS U2 ON (T.driver_id = U2.users_id AND U2.banned ='No')
WHERE T.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY T.request_at
