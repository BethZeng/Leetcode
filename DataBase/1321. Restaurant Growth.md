## Table 
* Customer

| Column Name   | Type    |
---- | ---
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |

(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.

This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.

visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) have visited the restaurant.

amount is the total paid by a customer.

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Write an SQL query to compute moving average of how much customer paid in a 7 days window (current day + 6 days before) .

The query result format is in the following example:

Return result table ordered by visited_on.

average_amount should be rounded to 2 decimal places, all dates are in the format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

select *
from (select visited_on,
      sum(total) over(order by visited_on rows 6 preceding) amount,
      round(avg(total) over(order by visited_on rows 6 preceding),2) average_amount
      from t1) t
where date_sub(visited_on, interval 6 day) >= (select min(visited_on) from customer)
