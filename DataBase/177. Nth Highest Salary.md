## Nth Highest Salary (Medium)

## Table
### Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

| Id | Salary |
---- | ---
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

```
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE var int;
# skip n-1 rows to return the nth row
SET var = N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary
      FROM Employee 
      # Arrange the salary in the descending order, return the first row after N-1 rows.
      ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET var
      
  );
END
```
