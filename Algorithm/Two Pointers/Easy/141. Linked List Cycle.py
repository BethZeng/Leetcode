'''
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Solution:

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while slow != fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
